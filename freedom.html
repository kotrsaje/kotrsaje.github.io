        <p class="w3-opacity button" style=" text-align: center">'FREEDOM, the irony' is a piece that shares life stories of people who lived through the Soviet times in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics(USSR). The varying stories of the past chase Soviet Union residents who reside as shadows today. It reflects the similarities with current life, propaganda, egoism and the irony of freedom. Visitors were able to become part of the digital projection and immerse in the Soviet environment lead by the daily routine sounds and by looking through the album full of images and stories that have been recorded by myself.</p>

            <p>The art piece explores the stigma about discussing politics, especially acknowledging relationships with post Soviet countries and Russia. Since countries, such as Lithuania, got their independence from the Soviet union in 1990, news began to be filled with bias towards the western culture side and disgracing people from the Russian culture. This bias has been rapidly continued up to this day. With my piece, I wanted to show that no matter the time frame, people, without putting more effort into learning about other cultures and realising how politics are the main players that gamble with society; will only leave people to believe in what the media perceives to be the truth and will be trapped in their own culture’s propaganda. People believed that USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) was full of slander and propaganda. However, some of us don’t see that it’s still exactly the same but our current world is similar only to be shaped in a different form. </p></div>

                        <p>Before I started working on my piece I had an idea to create and art piece related to USSR’s secret police called, Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (KGB) and the lack of the privacy. However, as I continued working on my idea and discussing Soviet past with my relatives, it made me realise that the conversations are very personal and instead of showing the lack of privacy I wanted to use the most personal and sentimental quotes as a huge part of the piece. Therefore, I have decided to recreate the Soviet Room and create a book for the piece as well.</p></div>

<p>I have been highly affected to see the KGB cells in the KGB museum in Lithuania. People were tortured and kept in terrible conditions. Those who were spied on by KGB did not have any privacy. At first I wanted to represent the irony, how back in the day people were scared to have their privacy interfered by KGB spies. However, now we are sharing our every step of the day on social media. Furthermore, walking through KGB museum had given me a better idea of how USSR interiors looked like.</p> </div>

                    <p>A British documentary filmmaker, Adam Curtis, made a movie called, “Hypernormalisation”. The movie talks about a “fake world” built by corporations and kept stable by the politicians. The term “hypernormalisation” comes from a book called, “Everything was Forever, Until it was No More: The Last Soviet Generation” written by Alexei Yurchak. The book talks  about the paradoxes of life in the Soviet Union during the 20 years before it collapsed. Yurchak argued in his book, that everyone knew the system was failing, but no one could imagine an alternative. “Over time, this delusion became a self-fulfilling prophecy and the "fakeness" was accepted by everyone as real, an effect that Yurchak termed 'hypernormalisation'" (Klumbyte, 2012). Adam Curtis’ movie has led me to read the book and gave me a better understanding about the past society of the Soviet Union and people who struggle to this day, facing the changes and the culture that changed abruptly. </p></div>

                    <p>The ideology of soviet union made Lithuanian people believe that everything is normal. There was no alternative. But people were fighting for freedom, which they got eventually, but now they migrate massively. Currently, people in general, have removed their own freedom by losing their free time to travel, work or work on their goals -- by sacrificing long hours to social media.</p> </div>

            <p>For few weeks I would meet up with my relatives who have lived through different parts of Soviet Union and I have opened a discussion by asking about what was it like to live in the Soviet regime. I have recorded the conversations secretly to get more intimate answers. Majority agreed that USSR lacked freedom. Yurchak, also mentioned that “The Soviet system produced tremendous suffering, repression, fear, and lack of freedom, all of which are well documented.” (Yurchak, 2013). However, my relatives nostalgically pointed out that the life was better then  and the propaganda that was following everyone’s step they took is coming back as we are all becoming puppets controlled by the politicians. The weirdest plot twist I have faced when talking about the relatives made me realise how much people are affected by the Soviet regime, where people would understand that what is happening is not right. Nevertheless they would never talk about it publicly, only in private corners of the house. </p></div>
        
                <div class="w3-container w3-center" style="margin-top: 5px; text-indent:10%"> 
                    <p>“The subject of late Soviet society was a dissimulator who acted differently in two different spheres, the “official public” and the “hidden intimate.” According to that model, the dissimulating subject was split: its hidden intimate self was only “available to the gaze of the closest friends or family members but sometimes kept secret even from them”, making it possible to spot these dissimulators only when they “suddenly let their strict self-control go and [broke] their utmost secrecy.” (Yurchak, 2013). Talking about topics that would never appear in regular conversations, I have had with my relatives, made me realise how this is relatable with the current society and western world. Having to believe that we have a freedom of speech creates a paradox, because one is still afraid to share their thoughts and their beliefs. Politics and religion are two topics that would only be touched with the closed ones, but rarely shared publicly to avoid the shame, humiliation and unnecessary arguments.</p> </div>

                    <p> “Pussy Riot” is the group of post-punk feminist arts collective from Russia, that suffered harsh consequences after fighting against the Russian political system. The Saatchi gallery ran an immersive theatre experience “Inside Pussy Riot” which I have visited in the autumn of 2017. The experience showed the braviness of women that fought against the injustice in Russia, knowing the consequences. One of their most famous performances "Mother of God, Drive Putin Away" took a place in an orthodox church after Vladimir Putin was re-elected again. Wearing colorful balaclavas they ran into the church screaming and jumping around. After this performance, a couple of the Pussy Riot members were caught and charged with hooliganism and were sentenced to 7 years in prison. The immersive theatre experience incredibly showed what they had to go through. Nonetheless, their actions encouraged people to not be afraid of taking a step towards fighting justice. This was one of the art pieces that pushed me to make something political and especially show the hidden beliefs and fares people face to this day in the society that is believed to have “freedom”. </p></div>

                    <p>As I have decided to work with the stories of my relatives to create an immersive art piece I have started recording the conversations. At first I wanted to play conversations with subtitles during the installation, but I have later decided that it would be better to create a book and use the quotes in the book instead. The reason of that, because the relatives in the conversations did not speak english, and subtitles would make projection on the installation too messy and would distract from the videos. Later I have decided that playing regular domestic sounds would create a different and more immersive atmosphere. I started working with the code first as I wanted to make sure technical part of my project is done before I could start working on the designing and editing videos. After I have finished with the video I have started working on the book.  I have been looking around what kind of objects I would need for the room and how to make the piece look aesthetic. My inspiration was my grandma’s flat, I have been trying to collect similar items. The curtain I have used for the projection is one of the main objects that was found in the Soviet houses. Initially the curtain was supposed to cover the front of the room and make the space more private. After hanging the projector, I have realised that placing the curtain on the space where the views is going to be projected. Therefore, it would make the projection more interesting and the space would look like it’s a window.  </p></div>

       With my art piece, I was trying to make it as immersive as I could. The aim was to recreate a Soviet styled room. Therefore, allowing the audience to feel a part of it and for some to relate to the past. I have created a book with the images I have been taking mainly with a film camera and have been secretly recording intimate conversations with my relatives. The conversations included stories about their lives while living in the Soviet union. Stories vary from people telling how some either loved the life back in the Soviet times and to this day regret the freedom from the Soviet Union that Eastern European countries managed to win. Others understand the propaganda and agitation that was following citizens every day. However, they realise that it’s still happening even after Soviet Union collapsed. I have decided to record conversations without people knowing as this allowed to open up to me personally and talk about stories that are intimate and are kept as a secret. The book contained quotes from the conversations and images that were related to the domestic everyday life or some that contained hidden meaning behind and related to the quotes. As I wanted the audience to attract to the installation and have to fully immerse and engage with the projection and the book, I have been trying to create the attractive environment.  </p>

    The book and a camera was purposely placed on the table. This way, when people sit down by the table they would see the two layers of video projection. The videos I have chosen were the brutal stories of Soviet Union that people knew about but did speak of. Issues with KGB interrupting privacy and the fight for the Lithuania’s independence left innocent people dead. Another layer that was captured by the camera placed on the table and created a silhouette of the audience member. Inside the silhouette there was another video displaying the ironic and sweet part of Soviet past. I have collected archival footages of the show that was called “Tarybu Lietuva” (Soviet Lithuania). The footage was made for the citizens of Soviet Union to show the idyllic life in USSR. I wanted to show the ambiguity of the Soviet regime and life with its irony. Knowing the political issues that have been happening in the Soviet times, people chose to only see the television series about how beautiful and unharmful life of Soviet Union is. Another reason why there was a sweet part displayed in the silhouette, is to represent the egoism and individualism. The silhouette was hiding the rough part -- meaning that even though people knew or still know that something bad is happening in the world or just a step away, yet we are all concentrated on our own lives and are not trying to change anything or at least until it starts to affect our own lifes. The Silhouette is also like a shadow that follows people like a past that they can’t forget. I have been trying to show that it’s not only the Soviet Union that was corrupted and full of propaganda. I wanted the audience, while reading the stories and seeing the projection, to relate it to the current issues of today's politics and society. The stories in the book were not sequential as I wanted people to open any page and have their own perception about what they read. Even though the stories were about the past, I wanted people to notice that it feels like the stories are telling about current events. However, I wanted to use USSR as a theme as it is personal to me and it’s something that has affected my family, relatives and myself.

   The reason the piece is called “FREEDOM, the irony” because it represents the irony of the way people wanted to escape the Soviet Union to have a freedom in Lithuania. People fought for years and after they eventually succeeded now we have another freedom to fight for. People are leaving their countries because they don’t feel happy or successful in their own country and believe that they could succeed somewhere else. Now the shadow of the past is following them and the lack of privacy and knowledge about what’s going on in the world is becoming another issue.

        In Lithuania Soviet symbolism is banned, but in United Kingdom this law does not exist. I have been using some soviet symbolism in the projection and used badges that my parents gave me for my piece. For the audio, I have recorded some sounds in my grandmother’s old soviet block house and some other daily routine sounds to play as a background in the piece. I was aiming to recreate the environments of the Soviet daily routine as this would allow the audience to immerse more.

                    <p>To create an interactive projection, I have used OpenFrameworks. I have been using OpenCV addon, which allowed me to create a threshold. The threshold increased the contrast of the video. Therefore, whatever is bright detected by the camera would become white and what’s dark would become black. This way by placing the camera on the table and the lamp next to it that lit up the person sitting next to the book, it created a silhouette of a person.

After creating the transparent black pixels, I have played another video, which played as a background behind the silhouette.

                    <p>I have made the videos to play inside the the silhouette and the background transparent. I have played the video on the background and because the blacks in the threshold were transparent it made the background video visible and silhouette could have been drawn on top.

                    <p>At first, I was concerned, as I thought that the audience won't bother to look through the book and won’t want to stay engaged with the piece for a long enough. I also thought that nobody will want to sit down in that small area and would feel embarrassed or intimidated by sitting down inside the installation. But during the exhibition I have received feedback from the audience saying that the installation was so immersive that it makes viewers forget that they are actually in the exhibition. However, a lot of people looked through the whole book and were amazed how much the overall piece matches all together. I’ve got a lot of people from Post-soviet countries that have came up to me saying how much the piece have touched them and how they do agree and understand the quotes and the meaning behind the footage. Nevertheless, viewers that haven't had any experience with the Soviet past were impressed with the piece as well and stayed for a long time to read through the book and to immerse into the environment.

                    <p>Even though at the beginning I have started by creating a project about the lack a of the privacy and wanted to recreate the KGB interrogation room, I am happy with the result I have ended up with. Throughout creation of the piece I have started to create something very personal and interesting to me. As I have had enough time to finish the piece I wouldn’t change anything about it. There a lot of things that could have been much better, but with the small budget and limited time I am satisfied with what I’ve ended up creating.

                    <p>As I come from the photography background I have realised that making this piece allowed me to use photographs as one of the main parts of the piece and have computational installation together with that. It made me realise as well that doing a photography exhibition does not have to be done only by displaying the photographs on the walls. There are many ways to perceive photography. There could be an installation done that allows the viewer not only observe the photographs but to feel a part of the stories behind the photographs. This project gave me a great idea what I would like to work on in the future, and the type of installations I would want to do. I would like to do more photography based immersive installations and share different stories covering various global issues.
